# Pre-registered Decisions

Interpretations and ranges committed before the results that would test them are
seen. The commit history dates each entry, which is the point: a prediction recorded
afterwards is not a prediction.

## The polarity experiment, registered 28 September 2026

PPG-DaLiA's wrist channel is inverted relative to the conventional PPG PaPaGei was
pre-trained on. Embeddings are already cached in both polarities, so the experiment
is to run the reproduction both ways and compare each against the published 11.53 and
10.92, and against the distribution over all 455 possible test triples.

Three outcomes, with what each licenses:

1. **Unflipped lands inside the distribution, flipped does not.** The pipeline is
   correct and the reproduction is anchored. Polarity then becomes a separate claim
   about how well the encoder reads wrist data, reported as a discussion point and a
   named future-work direction.
2. **Flipped lands inside, unflipped does not.** This does not license any conclusion
   about polarity. It would mean PaPaGei flips the signal somewhere we have not
   found, and the response is to go looking again, not to conclude.
3. **Both land inside.** Polarity does not move the number materially. Report it,
   close the thread, move on.

Registered in advance because outcome 2 is confusing if met cold, and the temptation
on meeting it would be to read it as support for the hypothesis when it is the
opposite.

## Hyperparameter ranges, registered 28 September 2026

Committed before the first ridge regression is fitted, and therefore before any
reproduction or Arm A number exists. The claim in the methodology that search ranges
are fixed in advance is only meaningful if the commit that fixes them precedes the
commit that produces the results.

**The grid.** Ridge regularisation strength alpha over `numpy.logspace(-3, 6, 10)`,
that is 1e-3 to 1e6 in ten logarithmic steps. Selection is by mean absolute error in
BPM, the same metric the study reports, computed per subject and averaged so that
selection and evaluation measure the same thing.

**Selection under PaPaGei's protocol, for the reproduction.** Their split is nine
training, three validation and three test subjects. Enumerating all 455 test triples
leaves a free choice of which three of the remaining twelve become validation, and
with 455 triples there is enough variation to tune against by accident. The rule,
fixed here: **the three lowest remaining subject identifiers become validation**, the
other nine train. Deterministic, stated in advance, and independent of any result.

**Selection under leave-one-subject-out, for Arm A.** There is no validation set,
since fourteen subjects train and one is held out. Alpha is chosen by grouped
cross-validation within the fourteen, **grouped by subject so that no subject appears
in two folds**, using `GroupKFold` with **seven folds of two subjects each**, which
divides evenly. The held-out subject takes no part in selection.

**Applies to every arm that fits a ridge**, which is A, B and B2 directly, and C1 as
its warm start. Arm C1's shrinkage strength and Arm C2's rank are separate ranges and
are registered before those arms run, not here.

## Scope

Polarity is a side experiment of about a day. It does not displace the frontier. If
the effect is material it becomes a discussion section, not a change of direction.
